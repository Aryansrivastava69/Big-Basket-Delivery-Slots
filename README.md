# Big-Basket-Delivery-Slots
It's a major hassle to get delivery slots available on Big Basket due to the Covid-19(Coronavirus) situation. 
This is a small utility script written to automate the process and notify you when a slot becomes available! 

## How to execute the script
This script uses python 2.7.
1) Checkout the repo 
2) Run `pip install -r requirements`
3) If you don't have chromedriver installed, download it from https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads. (Make sure the version of your driver is same as your browser. You can check out your browser's major version in the Menu `About Chrome`. 
4) Move the driver to the directory of the script and then run the script `python BB_slot.py`.


## How to proceed further
1) Make sure your basket is already prepared.
2) A popup opens the first time script is executed. Go to the login tab and login to your account.(Make sure the correct address is selected!)
3) Now wait! Let the script run in the background while you go Netflix. Make sure the laptop does not go to sleep.
4) Once a slot becomes available, a notification will pop up.



I saw this idea for Amazon US and Whole Foods in this repo https://github.com/pcomputo/Whole-Foods-Delivery-Slot and decided to do the same for BigBasket, India.
